# Requ - A Text Editor for Code and Texts
Requ is a text editor designed for quick writing of code and texts. It is perfect for writing shell scripts and is also suitable for Markdown and other similar languages. Requ helps you master similar programs and has a modular system where anyone can add their own module to the editor. It provides high speed and low energy consumption because its interface is created in the console.

Requ has many advantages over other editors. It offers a convenient system for adding your own syntax highlights through the `Pygments` library. It also allows you to change keyboard bindings and color themes. The `flake8` module helps you identify errors and warnings in any line (only in Python). Requ includes many other functions that aid in development.

## Installation
Installing Requ is straightforward. You need Python version 3.11 or higher and a couple of minutes of your time. Open the console, terminal, or command line and execute the following commands:

### Windows
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/requiep/requ-im.git
$ cd requ-im
$ bin/requ.bat
$ requ -i <your-python-folder-path>
```

### MacOS, Linux
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/requiep/requ-im.git
$ cd requ-im
$ source bin/requ.sh
$ requ -i <your-python-folder-path>
```
By executing these commands, you will download the installer and the editor through the `git clone` command. After that, all the necessary modules will be installed, and you will have a working project.
