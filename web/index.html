                <h1>RequIm - a simple text editor for everything.</h1>
                <span>
                    This code editor is very simple, and its philosophy is also minimal. 
                    It occupies minimal memory on your device and is built on Python, 
                    which itself is cross-platform. However, there are some downsides: 
                    it is quite slow, although this is almost unnoticeable due to the 
                    size of the project itself. You can download it from our GitHub 
                    page: <a href="https://github.com/requiep/requ-im.">github</a> You can also find more 
                    information there. The philosophy of this project lies in the 
                    fact that you can open text files of any size in this editor. 
                    The file is read differently here, with the text organized as a 
                    two-dimensional matrix where the columns are emphasized. However, 
                    this feature consumes most of the resources, but it can be turned 
                    off in the configuration file, <code>requ.yml</code>.
                </span>
                <h1>Syntax highlighting:</h1>
                <span>
                    Syntax highlighting is present in this editor, implemented through
                    the pygments module. It offers many functionalities, from creating 
                    your own lexer for highlighting to supporting highlighting for 
                    almost all programming languages. The module is easy to integrate 
                    into your own project. All the code for syntax highlighting can be 
                    found in the folder <code>lib/modules/syntax/[...]</code>. You can also add your 
                    own lexers or install them using plugins that can be downloaded
                    from our website.

                <h1>Python syntax check with flake8:</h1>
                <span>
                    This project also includes a cool feature called syntax check, 
                    following the pep8 standards. This is for convenience and to 
                    encourage proper and beautiful code writing in Python. The settings 
                    for this feature can be found in the directory where the flake 
                    module is located, specifically in <code>lib/modules/flake/[...</code>].
                </span>
                <h1>Hotkey system:</h1>
                <span>
                    Hotkeys are a crucial aspect of this project as they significantly 
                    speed up code writing. There is a simple system that allows you to 
                    edit the hotkeys, just like any other aspect of the project. To do 
                    this, go to the <code>lib</code>/ folder and find the keybind.py file. You can 
                    add your own hotkeys there or add them using plugins. All keys are 
                    arranged optimally from my point of view. You can also change the 
                    layout to Vim or the classic one, or create your own layout. This 
                    can be done through code, but it's better to use plugins as it 
                    simplifies the process and reduces the chance of errors.
                </span>
                <h1>Plugin system:</h1>
                <span>
                    This project supports plugins, which work in a simple manner. 
                    A plugin is just a piece of code that takes arguments and interacts
                    with the existing code. Creating plugins is straightforward. 
                    You need to create a Python class object and write an <code>__init__</code>
                    function that accepts <code>*args.</code> Then, you can access the elements 
                    through indexes. For example, the first element passed via <code>*args</code>
                    is a dictionary that contains editor elements such as the file manager, 
                    syntax highlighting, configurations, and the editor class itself.

                <span>
                    You can move through the file with the help of the cursor, as well as with the arrows on
                    keyboard and letters : down : Ctrl+A, up : Ctrl+K<br><br>

                    You can also move around the file using the mouse, but also through the keys
                    for example: To the end of the file: Ctrl+L, to the beginning of the text: Ctrl+B<br><br>

                    You can also move around the line using the keys : Line Left : Ctrl+D,
                    right line : Ctrl+T, Delete line : Ctrl+R<br><br>

                    Find the right word in the file : Ctrl+F, update flake8 for python : Ctrl+E<br><br>

                    Save file with Ctrl+S, create new file with Ctrl+N<br><br>

                    Close editor : Ctrl+Q<br><br>
