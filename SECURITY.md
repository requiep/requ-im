## Reporting Security Issues
At RequIm, we take security seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the broader community to responsibly disclose any potential vulnerabilities they find.

If you discover a security issue in our project, we kindly request that you report it to our security team by emailing us at requiepmail@gmail.com. Please do not create GitHub issues or discuss the issue in public forums until we have had a chance to address it.

To ensure the security issue is resolved as quickly as possible, please provide us with the following details in your report:

A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
Steps to reproduce the vulnerability or a proof-of-concept.
The version of the project where the vulnerability was found.
Any additional information that may be helpful in understanding and reproducing the issue.
We commit to acknowledging your email within 1-4 days and will provide you with regular updates throughout the process of addressing the vulnerability. We kindly ask for your patience and understanding while we investigate and respond to your report.

## Scope
This security policy covers the entire RequIm project, including all its official repositories and associated codebases.

## Vulnerability Disclosure
Upon receiving a security report, we will:

- Confirm the vulnerability and assess its impact on the project.
- Prioritize the reported issue based on its severity.
- Investigate the issue and develop a resolution.
- Develop and test the necessary patches or fixes.
- Coordinate the release of the fix and any necessary security updates.
- Provide credit and recognition to the reporter if desired and appropriate.
- Maintain open communication throughout the process.
## Patching Policy
We strive to address security vulnerabilities in a timely manner and provide patches or fixes according to the following guidelines:

- Critical severity issues: We will make every effort to address critical vulnerabilities as soon as possible, aiming to release a patch or fix within 1-4 days.
- High severity issues: We will prioritize high-severity vulnerabilities and aim to release a patch or fix within 1-4 days.
- Moderate severity issues: We will address moderate-severity vulnerabilities in a reasonable timeframe, depending on the complexity of the issue and our development roadmap.
- Low severity issues: While we appreciate reports of low-severity vulnerabilities, they may not be addressed immediately. However, we will evaluate each case individually and determine the appropriate course of action.
## Feedback and Recognition
We value the security community and the important role it plays in improving the security of our project. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or general security-related comments, we encourage you to reach out to us at requiepmail@gmail.com.

We also appreciate the efforts of security researchers and individuals who responsibly disclose security issues. If you would like to be recognized for your contribution, please let us know in your report. We are open to providing public credit and acknowledgment, unless you request to remain anonymous.

We thank you for your interest in the security of our project and for helping us ensure the privacy and safety of our users and their data.
